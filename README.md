# virtual-pet
A Tamagotchi clone that will start as a small side-project, but hopefully evolve into a 
fully functional working Tamagotchi

## Main Project Objectives
- Create the UI in HTML and CSS to give the look as a egg-shaped virtual pet
- Create the buttons for feeding, playing, and cleaning the pet
- Add the option to name your pet and have the name displayed on the pet-screen
- Hook up the Javascript. When you feed or play with your pet it's happiness and hunger level will raise
- When you neglect your pet the happiness will drop
